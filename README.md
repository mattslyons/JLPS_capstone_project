__Air pollution kills children.__

Exposure to dangerous levels of air pollution is estimated to kill over 600,000 children every year worldwide, with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) believed to be the most deadly.

But despite a good body of literature examining pollution-related health outcomes and mortality among adults and the elderly, the extent to which exposure to PM2.5 leads to chronic health conditions among children is not well-understood.

We aim to quantify the impact of PM2.5 on various pediatric medical diagnoses using an instrumental variables regression design.
