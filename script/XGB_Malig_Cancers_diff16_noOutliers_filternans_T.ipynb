    "# About\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook runs XGBoost to produce Stage 1 and Stage 2 results for a specified instrument, lag/lead, health outcome, and fixed effects combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost models were hyperparameter tuned using 5 fold time series cross validation (expanding window). \n",
    "- The best parameters were used to train a full model on the 2002-2017 datasets. \n",
    "- Held out performance is best assessed from the CV split, since we don't have access to 2018 data for PM2.5 or health.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2nd stage regression predicts the medical outcomes using the predicted PM2.5, as well as the same fixed effects from the first stage regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2nd stage model is used to make counterfactual predicted health outcomes if we reduced air pollution (predicted PM2.5)  by 1%, 10%, and 25%.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Running this notebook requires the following file structure changes:\n",
    "- Just as in the OLS notebooks, please make sure the modeling data is in `'C:/Users/cilin/Research/CA_hospitals_capstone/data/'` and the medical data is in `'C:/Users/cilin/Research/CA_hospitals_capstone/output/'`. Please make sure these are named the same as when you ran the OLS notebooks.\n",
    "- Add a new directory or make sure this one exists: `out_dir_xgb = 'C:/Users/cilin/Research/CA_hospitals_capstone/xgb/'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also ensure that you have the `xgboost` package in your Python interpreter. If using conda, you can install xgboost\n",
    "- This notebook uses the sklearn api for xgboost: `xgb.XGBRegressor()`\n",
